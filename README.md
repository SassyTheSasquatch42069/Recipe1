PROG Recipe App:

This app allows a user to create, save, view and delete recipes.
When the User wants to create a new recipe, the app will prompt the user with a message asking for the recipe name, ingredients, quantity, unit of measurement and the number of steps. All the inputs that the user gives for each of these will be saved in arrays.
Once the User has entered a recipe, they can then make the app display their recipe. This is done by taking the arrays that has the recipe info stored and displaying in through a for loop.
The User can also factor the recipe based on the serving they want to choose. This is done by taking the factor chosen and multiplying it with the qunatities of the recipe.
The user also has the options to reset the qunatities back into their original quantities.
Another option available to the user is to clear the recipes they have stored. This is done by making the arrays empty and making it have a value of 0.
The last Function is to exit the application.
